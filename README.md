# Dunn-Differentiation-Method
Dunn method using differentation to seperate the diffusion region and capacitive region of a CV diagram


This is very badly written but it works :D
If you're not using the same testing rig as me then it wont work and you'll have to change the data extraction code.
I have heard it be called the Conway method so maybe Ive got the wrong name.
This is for my ChemEng masters so excuse the messy code.
